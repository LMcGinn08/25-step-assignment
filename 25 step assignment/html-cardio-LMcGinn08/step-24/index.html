      ## Step 24
      
      ### Your Favorite Books
      
      Now that you have learned how to create HTML headings, lists, and code special characters, you can put your skills to the test!
      
      ### Do This
      
      1. Create a web page about your favorite books!
         - For example, this web page could include information about your favorite genre of books and then a list of your top 3 favorites!
         - You could even do favorite books and use the horizontal rule tag to separate the descriptions of each one!
      
      *You may not be able to create the "perfect" web page just yet, but you can develop a prototype that shows your general idea!*
