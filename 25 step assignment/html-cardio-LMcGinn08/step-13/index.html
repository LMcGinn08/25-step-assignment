      ## Step 13

      ### Heading Sizes
      
      Headings can come in different sizes. In this page, there are six different sized headings, but they are all mixed up. 
      Can you and your partner figure out how to fix them?
      
      ### Do This:
      
      1. Change the tags so that the headings are in order from biggest to smallest, and the text says the correct size, as in the picture to the right.

    -->
     <h1>Biggest</h1>
   <h2>Medium Big</h2>
   <h3>Big</h3>  
    <h4>Small</h4>
    <h5>Medium Small</h5>
   <h6>Smallest</h6>
