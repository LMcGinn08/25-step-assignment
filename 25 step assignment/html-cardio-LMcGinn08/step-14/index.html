      ## Step 14

      ### Unordered Lists
      
      There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.
      
      An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.
      
      An unordered list element has the tag `<ul>`. This is an abbreviation for Unordered List.
      
      Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li>`. This is an abbreviation for List Item. The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list (`<ul>`).
      
      Take a look at how the given code below creates an unordered list. Pay special attention to the whitespace and indentation of the `<li>`.
      
      ### Do This
      
      1. Look at how the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags are used to create an unordered list.
      2. Use the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to create your own dessert list.
