      ## Step 15

      ### Ordered Lists
      
      An ordered list is like an unordered (bulleted) list, but it has numbers. Just use the `<ol>` tag instead of `<ul>`.
      
      This is an abbreviation for Ordered List.
      
      Just like your bulleted list, each item in the ordered (numbered) list is marked by a list item element `<li>`;. 
      This is an abbreviation for List Item. The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the ordered list (`<ol>`).
      
      ### Do This
      
      1. Use the `<ol>` and `<li>` tags to structure this content into an ordered list.

    <ol>
      <li>They are cute.</li>
      <li>They are easy to take care of.</li>
      <li>They don't bite or scratch.</li>
      <li>They will eat all your leftovers.</li>
      <li>They are good listeners.</li>
    </ol>
