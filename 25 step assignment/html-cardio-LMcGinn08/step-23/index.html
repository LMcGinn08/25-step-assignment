      ## Step 23
      
      ### Extra Code: Special Character "&"
      
      The ampersand character (&) can cause errors in your HTML code because it is actually used for other 
      special characters like less than symbols (< is encoded as `&lt;`), and double quotation marks (" is encoded as `&quot;`).
      
      To use the & character in a paragraph correctly, you need the special code `&amp;`. Yes, you need an ampersand to encode an ampersand!
      In this activity, you'll make up a list some of your favorite things and practice using ampersands.
      
      ### Do This
      
      1. Read the HTML and look for where the &amp; code is used correctly.
      2. Replace the ampersand that is causing pink code with the special code for the symbol.
      3. Fill in the blank categories or add your own using the new code. Try to come up with answers that use the symbol!
