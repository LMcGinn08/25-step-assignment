## Step 1
    
### Add Text to the Body
The HTML Skeleton contains `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags in your project. 
When you add content to your projects, you'll need to do it between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags because it should be part of the body of your webpage.
    
### Do This
Finish adding `<p>` and `</p>` tags to the code below so each sentence appears on a separate line.
Preview the code to verify that each line appears on its own.

## Step 2

### Use Paragraph Tags

The `<p>` `</p>` tags or "paragraph" start and end tags are placed around text to indicate that it is part of a paragraph. 
Placing text between paragraph start and end tags lets the computer know that it should be treated differently, often just spacing it out from other text.

### Do This

1. Click in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags - this is where you'll add your code
2. Create two paragraphs that ask a question and answer it. This can be a trivia question, a riddle, or a joke.
   - For example: "What continent has the largest land mass?" - "Asia"
4. Place the text you just wrote inside two separate paragraphs by surrounding each line with `<p>` and `</p>` tags

## Step 3

### Do This

1. Fix the broken code so that the web page displays correctly with each sentence on its own line.

## Step 4

### Create your own Paragraphs

Now that we know how to add `<p>` tags to our code, let's re-do the step 1 from this lesson and write our name, favorite color, and favorite animal on separate lines

### Do This

1. Use `<p>` and `</p>` tags to write your name, your favorite color, and your favorite animal on separate lines
   - Don't forget to type these in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags!
2. Preview the webpage to verify that each line appears on its own

## Step 5

### Fortunately / Unfortunately Stories

A Fortunately / Unfortunately story is a story that starts with an initial sentence, and then alternates between sentences that start with "fortunately" and "unfortunately". For example:

>A man needed to go to the grocery store to buy some milk
Fortunately, he had a car that he could drive to the store
Unfortunately, the car was out of gas
Fortunately, there was a gas station nearby that he could walk to
Unfortunately, the path to the gas station went through the swamp that was infested with crocodiles

### Do This

1. Work with your partner to add alternating sentences to the story below. One person should add the "fortunately" sentences, and the other person should add the "unfortunately" sentences
   - Be sure to use `<p>` and `</p>` tags so each line of the story appears as a separate line
2. Repeat this until the story is at least 8 lines long

## Step 6

#### \* Pyramid

Use paragraph tags to create a sideways pyramid out of \* symbols. Each line of the pyramid should be its own paragraph

```
*

**

***

****

*****

****

***

**

*
```

### Do This

1. Recreate a pyramid out of \* symbols that is 5 \*'s long.
   - Be sure to use `<p>` and `</p>` tags so each line of the pyramid appears as a separate line
  
## Step 7

### Fixing Dialogue

A screenwriter tried to copy-and-paste their dialogue from a play into a webpage, but the formatting got all messed up. 
Can you separate each piece of dialogue so it's on it's own line?

### Do This

1. Separate the dialogue into separate lines so each person is speaking on their own line
2. Use `<p>` and `</p>` tags so each line appears correctly on the website

## Step 8

### Debug: Fix the Typos

Sometimes mistakes appear in our code because we mis-type or misspell something. Try to fix the errors in the code below by fixing the spelling mistakes
Do This

1. Fix the broken code so that the web page displays correctly. Hint: there are 3 errors in the code below.
2. If stuck, collaborate with a neighbor to fix all the problems. 

## Step 9

### Debug: Out of Order

Even though the preview of this webpage looks just fine, all of the code is out of order! This will cause problems later, so it's important everything is formatted and nested correctly. 
Can we rearrange the code so it is formatted correctly?

### Do This

1. Re-arrange the code using copy-and-paste so the tags are in the correct order and nested correctly
2. If stuck, collaborate with a neighbor to fix all the problems.

## Step 10

### Write a Poem

Use paragraph tags to write you own poetry, with each line separated by paragraph tags!

### Do This

1. Write a poem that is at least 5 lines long!
2. Use `<p>` and `</p>` tags to separate the poem onto separate lines

## Step 11

### ASCII Art

ASCII Art is a type of artwork what just uses keyboard characters to create images. Each image is just a combination of letters or symbols or piece of punctuation from the keyboard.
Do This

1. Create your own ASCII art, using `<p>` and `</p>` tags to separate the image onto separate lines. You could try to draw a design, or even just spell your name with ASCII symbols
   - If in doubt: try creating designs using just the \* symbol, like stars or mountains or letters.

Example:  
```

JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF  FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
J::::::::::::::::J  E:::::::::::::::E  F:::::::::::::::F  F:::::::::::::::F
JJJJJJJJ::JJJJJJJJ  E::EEEEEEEEEEEEEE  F::FFFFFFFFFFFFFF  F::FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
       J::J         E::E               F::F               F::F
       J::J         E::EEEEEEEEEE      F::FFFFFFFFFF      F::FFFFFFFFFF
       J::J         E:::::::::::E      F:::::::::::F      F:::::::::::F
       J::J         E::EEEEEEEEEE      F::FFFFFFFFFF      F::FFFFFFFFFF
JJJJ   J::J         E::E               F::F               F::F
J::J   J::J         E::EEEEEEEEEEEEE   F::F               F::F
 J::::::J           E::::::::::::::E   F::F               F::F
  JJJJJJ            EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE   FFFF               FFFF

```

## Step 12

### Headings

So far, you've organized your content into paragraphs. Another way HTML allows you to organize your code is by using headings. 
A heading is a short piece of text that goes at the top of a section of content, like a title.

### Do This:

1. Find the headings in the web page below and use the Inspector Tool to see the code that makes them.
2. Change the code so that "Drawing" and "2 years" match the headings on the rest of the page.

## Step 13

### Heading Sizes

Headings can come in different sizes. In this page, there are six different sized headings, but they are all mixed up. 
Can you and your partner figure out how to fix them?

### Do This:

1. Change the tags so that the headings are in order from biggest to smallest, and the text says the correct size, as in the picture to the right.

## Step 14

### Unordered Lists

There are two types of lists in HTML, ordered and unordered lists.

An unordered list is just a set of bulleted items.

An unordered list element has the tag `<ul>`. This is an abbreviation for Unordered List.

Each item in the list is marked by a list item element `<li>`. This is an abbreviation for List Item. The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the unordered list (`<ul>`).

Take a look at how the given code below creates an unordered list. Pay special attention to the whitespace and indentation of the `<li>`.

### Do This

1. Look at how the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags are used to create an unordered list.
2. Use the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to create your own dessert list.

## Step 15

### Ordered Lists

An ordered list is like an unordered (bulleted) list, but it has numbers. Just use the `<ol>` tag instead of `<ul>`.

This is an abbreviation for Ordered List.

Just like your bulleted list, each item in the ordered (numbered) list is marked by a list item element `<li>`;. 
This is an abbreviation for List Item. The list item element is a child element, which means that it goes inside of its parent element, the ordered list (`<ol>`).

### Do This

1. Use the `<ol>` and `<li>` tags to structure this content into an ordered list.

## Step 16

### Debug: Missing Paragraph

Someone has submitted a bug report on this web page. Can you fix the bug?

| What I expected to happen	| What happened instead |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Three paragraphs, one each on dogs, turtles, and birds | The turtle paragraph is missing |

### Do this

1. Find and fix the problem that is causing the bug


## Step 17

### Debug: Broken Tags

Someone has submitted a bug report on this web page. Can you fix the bug?

| What I expected to happen	| What happened instead |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| The code should not be broken | There is broken code near lines 8, 13 and 14 |

### Do this

1. Find and fix the problem that is causing the bug

## Step 18

### Debug: Invalid Heading Tags

Someone has submitted a bug report on this web page. Can you fix the bug?

| What I expected to happen | What happened instead |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| The code is invalid | There is invalid code near line 12 and line 14 |

### Do this

1. Find and fix the problem that is causing the bug.

## Step 19

### Debug: Invalid Subheading Tags

Someone has submitted a bug report on this web page. Can you fix the bug?

| What I expected to happen | What happened instead |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| The code is invalid | There is invalid code near line 12 and line 14 |

### Do this

1. Find and fix the problem that is causing the bug.


## Step 20

### Add Larger Heading and List

Here's a great article on modes of transportation. Can you add a catchy, large heading and title it?

### Do this

1. Add a larger heading at the top of the article.
   - Bonus Challenge: Can you turn the subheadings into a bulleted list?


## Step 21
### Extra Code: Line Break

In some situations, like a poem or a list, you'll want to start a new line inside the same paragraph, like you might do in poetry. 
You can use the line break `<br>` tag for this.

### Do This

1. Read the HTML and look for where the line break `<br>` code is used to separate the lines in the poem.
2. Add two more line breaks to separate out the other lines in the poem.

*Tip: The `<br>` tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.*
*Note: Use the `<br>` tag to enter line breaks, not to separate paragraphs. Always separate each paragraph with its own set of `<p>` and `</p>` tags!*

## Step 22

### Extra Code: Horizontal Rule

In some situations, you'll want to insert a horizontal line, or rule, to break up themes in your page. You can use the horizontal rule `<hr>` tag for this.

### Do This

1. Read the HTML and look for where the `<hr>` code is used to add a horizontal rule in the web page.
2. Add more horizontal rules to break up the page by theme.

## Step 23

### Extra Code: Special Character "&"

The ampersand character (&) can cause errors in your HTML code because it is actually used for other 
special characters like less than symbols (< is encoded as `&lt;`), and double quotation marks (" is encoded as `&quot;`).

To use the & character in a paragraph correctly, you need the special code `&amp;`. Yes, you need an ampersand to encode an ampersand!
In this activity, you'll make up a list some of your favorite things and practice using ampersands.

### Do This

1. Read the HTML and look for where the &amp; code is used correctly.
2. Replace the ampersand that is causing pink code with the special code for the symbol.
3. Fill in the blank categories or add your own using the new code. Try to come up with answers that use the symbol!

## Step 24

### Your Favorite Books

Now that you have learned how to create HTML headings, lists, and code special characters, you can put your skills to the test!

### Do This

1. Create a web page about your favorite books!
   - For example, this web page could include information about your favorite genre of books and then a list of your top 3 favorites!
   - You could even do favorite books and use the horizontal rule tag to separate the descriptions of each one!

*You may not be able to create the "perfect" web page just yet, but you can develop a prototype that shows your general idea!*

## Step 25

### Your Favorite Movies or Games

Now that you have learned how to create HTML headings, lists, and code special characters, you can put your skills to the test!

### Do This

1. Create a web page about your favorite movies or games!
   - For example, this web page could include information about your favorite genre of movies/games and then a list of your top 3 favorites!
   - You could even do favorite movies/games and use the horizontal rule tag to separate the descriptions of each one!

*You may not be able to create the "perfect" web page just yet, but you can develop a prototype that shows your general idea!*
