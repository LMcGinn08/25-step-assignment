      ## Step 12

      ### Headings
      
      So far, you've organized your content into paragraphs. Another way HTML allows you to organize your code is by using headings. 
      A heading is a short piece of text that goes at the top of a section of content, like a title.
      
      ### Do This:
      
      1. Find the headings in the web page below and use the Inspector Tool to see the code that makes them.
      2. Change the code so that "Drawing" and "2 years" match the headings on the rest of the page.

    <h1> My Hobbies </h1>

    <h2> Soccer </h2>
    <h4> 5 years </h4>
    <p>Soccer is an awesome sport because you get to
    play on a team with all your friends. I love
    challenge of learning new skills like headers
    and corner kicks.</p>

    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <h4> 10 years </h4>
    <p>I love baking because you put together all 
    these things that look simple and boring on 
    their own to make something magical and 
    delicious. I also love how baked things make 
    people happy. Sharing things I bake might be 
    the best part of it!</p> 

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <h4>2 years</h4> 
    <p>On the weekend sometimes I got outside and try
    to draw what I see. My favorite thing to draw
    are buildings. </p>
