      ## Step 21
      ### Extra Code: Line Break
      
      In some situations, like a poem or a list, you'll want to start a new line inside the same paragraph, like you might do in poetry. 
      You can use the line break `<br>` tag for this.
      
      ### Do This
      
      1. Read the HTML and look for where the line break `<br>` code is used to separate the lines in the poem.
      2. Add two more line breaks to separate out the other lines in the poem.
      
      *Tip: The `<br>` tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.*
      *Note: Use the `<br>` tag to enter line breaks, not to separate paragraphs. Always separate each paragraph with its own set of `<p>` and `</p>` tags!*
